Travel Distances MySQL/PHP Web Database App
Creating this to test/practice Ajax knowledge and to make 'travel report' submissions easier.

This is a Web based database of start and end travel locations in my work territory. Currently they are in a cross indexed excel spread sheet. This is teadious as each location has to be manually looked up. This take a lot of time. So this site allows the user to choose a "Start" and "End" dropdown box that references a MSQL database to search for the distance in miles between the two locations.

Here goes! :)
